## Project Introduction
The project analysis is based on data gained from Capital Bikeshare, a company that offers a bicycle sharing system in Washington, D.C. The goal of the project is to find patterns of the User behaviour and the demand of services in the different seasons and months of the year, as well as day of the week or time of the day.  
The result of analysis  will be then used to develop  KPI's suggestions to measure the business and ensure future growth.
At the end a model to forecast the anount of bikes used was created. At first we were provided with a dataset containing information about:  
* hourly and daily count of rental bikes for a period of  time 2011-2012;
* weather conditions such as: temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.;
* user type: registered, casual;
* travel duration;
* name of the start and end station;
* bike number.


Specifically, the project will focus on :
* The impact of the weather on the count of trips (incl.: creating a metric - weather score )
* Distribution of bike rentals by season and day of the week
* Users  behaviour (casual users vs registered users) depending on day of the week and time of the day
* Average duration of the trip depending on the season, day of the week, type of day for different types of users
* Distribution of stations according to popularity 
* Most used  stations by registered/casual users depending on time of the day (Morning,Afternon,Evening)
* Most popular routes by user group and  time of day
